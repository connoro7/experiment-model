## A simple tool for estimating A/B test durations.

You can use the experiment calculator at [http://www.experimentcalculator.com](http://www.experimentcalculator.com).

There is more information about this tool [on my blog](http://mcfunley.com/how-long-should-you-run-experiments).

Thanks to:
[Peter Keane](https://github.com/pkeane) for bug fixes.
